# gunshotDetector

August 20, 2017, Bayam√≥n Smart City IoT Hackathon

This is a project designed to detect gunshots using a Raspberry Pi 3, Cirrus Logic audio card, and microphone. Raspberry Pi acts as the server that holds the device information, coordinates, decibels, etc. in a MySQL database which is then displayed in a simple Dashboard.
